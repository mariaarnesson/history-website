             we usually hang photos on a wall in our homes. 
             In this article I would like to present how famous painters looked at the world and the work of art.
             And also I would like to interest you to the painting practice.</strong></h3>

      <h2>How artists feel about the meaning of life and art?</h2>
      <div id="leonardo" class="leonardo">
        <h3>Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519)</h3>
       
        <p> His combination of intellect and imagination allowed him to create, at least on paper,
            such inventions as the bicycle, the helicopter and an airplane based on the physiology and flying ability of a bat.</p>
        <ul>
          <li id="text.em">“Art is never finished, only abandoned.”</li>
          <li>“Where the spirit does not work with the hand, there is no art.”</li>
          <li>“Painting is poetry that is seen rather than felt, and poetry is painting that is felt rather than seen.”</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Pablo Picasso (1881-1973)</h3>
        <image src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/23/b0/cb/23b0cbb9b704cf7c03392018549e5e78.jpg" alt="pablo-picasso" id="image-pablo"></image>
        <p>Picasso expressed his feelings with his art. When his friend died, he was very sad,
             and spent years painting sad pictures in shades of blue (the blue period). Later, he fell in love,
              and his painting style again changed to shades of red and gold (the rose period).
             His style changed again and again throughout his life.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>“There is no abstract art. You must always start with something. Afterward you can remove all traces of reality.” </li>
          <li>“Who sees the human face correctly: the photographer, the mirror, or the painter?”</li>
          <li> “Colors, like features, follow the changes of the emotions.” </li>
        </ul>

          <h3>Roy Lichtenstein (1923-1997)</h3>

          <p>Roy Lichtenstein’s paintings broke boundaries,
             and he was among the very first American artists to embrace the movement and gain worldwide fame.
             His pop-art style was born on the occasion of painting popular Disney characters.</p>
          <ul><em>
              <li>"I'm trying to make paintings like giant musical chords, with a polyphony of colours that is nuts but works."</li>
              <li>"I like to pretend that my art has nothing to do with me. ”</li>
              <li>"Pop Art looks out into the world. It doesn't look like a painting of something, it looks like the thing itself. ”</li>
